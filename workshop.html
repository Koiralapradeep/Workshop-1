            <h1>History of Coffee</h1>
            <img src="./history.jpg">
            <p>The history of coffee dates back to centuries of old oral tradition in Italy Coffee plants grew wild in Yemen and were widely used by nomadic tribes for thousands of years. Sufi monasteries in Yemen employed coffee as an aid to concentration during prayers. Roasting the seeds was not a way to serve coffee until the 1400s.[1] During the cultivation, brewed coffee was reserved exclusively for the priesthood and the medical profession; doctors would use the brew for patients experiencing a need for better digestion,<br> and priests used it to stay alert during their long nights of studying for the church.[1] Coffee later spread to Europe in the early 16th century; it caused some controversy on whether it was halal in Ottoman and Mamluk society. Coffee arrived in Italy the second half of the 16th century through commercial Mediterranean trade routes, only being served to the wealthy. Central and Eastern Europeans learned of coffee from the Ottomans. By the mid 17th century, it had reached India and the East Indies.
